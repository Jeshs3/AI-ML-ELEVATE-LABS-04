Task 04

1. Linear regression predicts continuous numbers, like price or temperature. Logistic regression predicts probabilities for categories, like yes/no or 0/1.
2. The sigmoid function squashes any number into a value between 0 and 1. It is used in logistic regression to convert predictions into probabilities.
3. Precision tells us how many predicted positives were actually correct. Recall tells us how many actual positives we correctly identified.
4. The ROC-AUC curve shows how well a classifier separates classes at different thresholds. A higher area under the curve (AUC) means better performance.
5.A confusion matrix shows the number of correct and wrong predictions for each class. It helps understand where a model is making mistakes.
6. If one class is much bigger than the other, the model may ignore the smaller class. This can lead to misleading accuracy and poor predictions for the minority class.
7. The threshold decides which probability counts as a positive prediction. You can adjust it based on whether you want fewer false positives or fewer false negatives.
8. Yes, using methods like “one-vs-rest” or “softmax” logistic regression. This allows it to predict more than two classes instead of just yes/no.
